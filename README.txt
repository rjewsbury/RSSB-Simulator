~~RSSB Simulator~~
==================

RSSB is a URISC instruction that functions with only one argument

The compiler converts assembly-like .src files into RSSB instructions

The assembler converts RSSB into machine code, and handles the conversion between

The simulator models the process of an RSSB computer on physical hardware
